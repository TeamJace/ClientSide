Build and deploy a frontend

As a user, I want to display all of my books at once so that I can see everything in a single view.
Create a View container in your index.html file (for example, a <section>) for the following content:
List of all available books by author and title.
Include on the page the count of books that are in the DB.
Create an About View for displaying content about you and your application.
As a user, I want my books to be rendered dynamically so that I can view all of the books in my list.
As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my application is easy to navigate.
Style your site using a mobile-only approach. Use the provided wireframes as a general guideline for the minimum styling requirements, while adding your own personal taste and color palette.
Ensure the proper use of SMACCS principles.
STRETCH GOAL: Include icon fonts from a source such as Icomoon or FontAwesome for the social media icons you choose to include in the application.
As a user, I want to host my app on a reliable, scalable application hosting service (like gh-pages) so that I can access my mobile app when I'm on the go and share it with others.
